# SquadUp
  (name is already taken will change soon)

This is a solo capstone project to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I've gained.
A simple forum in style, I have implemented a payment system along side the ability to block IP addresses of users who break the rules of conduct. The goal is to try to create a gaming community that is inclusive and free from toxic behavior.


### Prerequisites

An up to date web browser.
Ability to clone the repository locally.
SQL
Ruby
Rails
StripeApi account

### Installing

Clone the repository on your local system and run these commands in the projects root folder in the terminal.

  * $ bundle install
  * $ rails setup


## Deployment

Next you will need your StripeApi publishable/secret keys.
Enter them into the terminal as follows.

  * $ PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your_key_here" SECRET_KEY =" your_key_here" rails s

Now the site should be live on http://localhost:3000


## Built With
* Ruby

* Rails

* Devise

* StripeApi

* HTML

* CSS

* Javascript

* Foundation


## Specs

Dwarf needs testing badly!


## Current known issues

  Fix signup not pushing user_name to the user table.
